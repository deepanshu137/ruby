	<h1>Ruby</h1>
<img src="ruby.png" width="500px;">
<p>Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.<br>
since its public release in 1995, Ruby has drawn devoted coders worldwide. In 2006, Ruby achieved mass acceptance. With active user groups formed in the world’s major cities and Ruby-related conferences filled to capacity.

Ruby-Talk, the primary mailing list for discussion of the Ruby language, climbed to an average of 200 messages per day in 2006. It has dropped in recent years as the size of the community pushed discussion from one central list into many smaller groups.

Ruby is ranked among the top 10 on most of the indices that measure the growth and popularity of programming languages worldwide (such as the TIOBE index). Much of the growth is attributed to the popularity of software written in Ruby, particularly the Ruby on Rails web framework.</p></div>
<div class="level2">
<h1>What Can we do with Ruby</h1>
<p>You can use Ruby just like you would use any other general-purpose scripting language. A few examples would be web applications, web servers, system utilities, database work, backups, parsing, even biology and medicine.

So you can use Ruby to do a lot of things. It’s not going to be good at all of them but at least it will allow you to get started, test some ideas and help you figure out if you need a more specialized language or not.</p>
</div>
<h2>
What is Ruby on Rails used for?
</h2>
<p>Ruby on Rails is use strictly for web development. It was built for that, and it’s doing a great job at it.

It’s the startup’s secret tool if you want. Because it allows you quickly spin up a prototype and test your ideas very cheaply.</p>

	<h1>Frameworks</h1>
	<details>Now I know, many of you will be outraged, saying that Sinatra is technically not a framework but rather a DSL (domain-specific language) for building websites, web services and web applications in Ruby. On the other hand, there are also some of you, that will keep insisting that it is widely considered as a framework, and therefore we’ve included it in this list. Sinatra, written in 2000 lines of Ruby, is the biggest of the frameworks on the list, but still it emphasizes the minimalistic approach to development, offering only what is necessary to handle HTTP requests and deliver responses to clients. Sinatra’s syntax is easy to understand and quite straightforward, and it allows for rapid API development, site building or creating a Ruby-based web service.

	<details>Padrino is a full-stack Ruby framework built upon the Sinatra web library. It might be based on Sinatra, but it adds many additional tools, such as having generators, tag helpers, caching, localization, mailers, etc. It is best suited for those who have an existing Sinatra app that is becoming more complex and warranting things that come in a full-stack framework. You can start with Sinatra and graduate to Padrino if needed

		Hanami is a full-stack Ruby web framework built by Luca Guidi, made up of small, single-purpose Ruby libraries. As the Hanami Team writes on their page, Hanami’s goal is to build lightweight apps which consume less memory than other Ruby web frameworks. Due to its size, Hanami is optimized for speed. Hanami is great for those developers that find themselves disagreeing with “The Rails Way,” or for those that really enjoy the Domain Driven Design approach.

	<details>Grape, or Generalized Rapid API Erector, is a REST-like API micro-framework built to complement existing frameworks. It does that, by providing a simple DSL, and was built to replace the API’s functionality of bigger frameworks like Rails, and Sinatra

	<details>Cuba is a microframework for web development, a small but powerful mapper for Rack applications. It is very close to Rack with very low overhead. Its best use is for small endpoints, where speed is important, or for those who want full control over their entire stack, adding additional gems and complexity as needed
		<summary>Cuba</summary>
	</details>
	<details>Roda is a web framework built on top of Rack, created by Jeremy Evans, that started as a fork of Cuba and was inspired by Sinatra. Roda (and Cuba) have a very unique approach to routing compared to Rails, Sinatra and other Ruby web frameworks. In Roda you route incoming requests dynamically as they come. Roda ships with lots of plugins for everyday needs, it comes with over 60 built in it.

	<details>Ramaze is a very simple and straightforward web-framework. The philosophy of it could be expressed in a mix of KISS(Keep It Simple Stupid) and POLA(Principle Of Least Astonishment). It’s built to follow the MVC pattern, though it’s possible to ‘deploy’ everything from within a single script. It supports all major templating systems, and its heavily focused on modular design.

		<h1>Benifits of using Ruby</h1>
		<p>The code written in Ruby has a fewer number of lines of code.<br>
This language allows simple and fast creation of Web application which results in much fewer efforts.<br>
It is an open source programming language which allows the programmers to modify the code as needed.<br>
</p>
	
	</div>
	<div>
		<h1>What makes it difficult</h1>
		<p>It is fairly new and has its own unique coding language which makes it difficult for the programmers to learn it.<br>
   The code written in Ruby is harder to debug as most of the time it generates the errors at runtime.<br>
   When compared to other languages, Ruby has very less informational resources to learn the language.<br>
   It is slower than other languages as it is an interpreted scripting language and the scripting languages are slower than the compiled languages.<br>
